    <h3>Thespis Act-1</h3>
    <h4>The ruins of the The Temple of the Gods, on summit of
        Mount Olympus.  Picturesque shattered columns, overgrown with
        ivy, etc. R. and L. with entrances to temple (ruined) R. Fallen
        columns on the stage. Three broken pillars 2 R.E.  At the back of
        stage is the approach from the summit of the mountain. This
        should be "practicable" to enable large numbers of people to
        ascend and descend.  In the distance are the summits of adjacent
        mountains. At first all this is concealed by a thick fog, which
        clears presently.  Enter (through fog) Chorus of Stars coming off
        duty as fatigued with their night's work
    </h4>

        <h5>PREP</h5>. It is enough that I am down-trodden in my profession. I
  will not submit to imposition out of it.  It is enough that as
  your heavy villain I get the worst of it every night in a combat
  of six.  I will not submit to insult in the day time. I have come
  out. Ha. Ha. to enjoy myself.
  <br>
  <h5>THES</h5>. But look here, you know—virtue only triumphs at night from
  seven to ten—vice gets the best of it during the other twenty
  one hours.  Won't that satisfy you? [Stupidas endeavours to
  pacify him.]
  <br>
  <h5>PREP</h5>. [Irritated to Stupidas] Ye are odious to my sight. Get out
  of it.
  <br>
  <h5>STUP</h5>. [In great terror] What have I done?
  <br>
<h5> PREP</h5>. Because he is a minion.
  <br>
  THES. He hates you because you are a minion.  It explains itself.
  Now go and enjoy yourselves. Ha. Ha. It is well for those who can
  laugh—let them do so—there is no extra charge.  The light-
  hearted cup and the convivial jest for them—but for me—what is
  there for me?
  <br>
<h5>SILLI</h5>. There is some claret-cup and lobster salad [handing some]
<br>
<h5>THES</h5>. [taking it] Thank you. [Resuming] What is there for me but
  anxiety—ceaseless gnawing anxiety that tears at my very vitals
  and rends my peace of mind asunder?  There is nothing whatever
  for me but anxiety of the nature I have just described. The
  charge of these thoughtless revellers is my unhappy lot.  It is
  not a small charge, and it is rightly termed a lot because there
  are many. Oh why did the gods make me a manager?
<br>
Here's a pretty tale for future Iliads and Odysseys
       Mortals are about to personate the gods and goddesses.
       Now to set the world in order, we will work in unity.
       Jupiter's perplexity is Thespis's opportunity.
