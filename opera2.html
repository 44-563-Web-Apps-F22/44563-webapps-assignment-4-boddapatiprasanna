  <h5 class="PREP, name">PREP</h5> 
  <p class="song">It is enough that I am down-trodden in my profession. I
  will not submit to imposition out of it. It is enough that as
  your heavy villain I get the worst of it every night in a combat
  of six. I will not submit to insult in the day time. I have come
  out. Ha. Ha. to enjoy myself.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h5 class="THIS">THES</h5>
<p class="speech">But look here, you know—virtue only triumphs at night from
  seven to ten—vice gets the best of it during the other twenty
  one hours. Won't that satisfy you? [Stupidas endeavours to
  pacify him.]
</p>
  <br>
  <h5 class="PREP">PREP</h5>
  <p class="speech">[Irritated to Stupidas] Ye are odious to my sight. Get out
  of it.</p>
  <br>
  <h5 class="STUP">STUP</h5>
  <p class="speech">[In great terror] What have I done?</p>

  <h5 class="PREP"> PREP</h5>
<p class="song">Because he is a minion.</p>
  <br>
  <h5 class="THIS">THES</h5>He hates you because you are a minion. It explains itself.
  Now go and enjoy yourselves. Ha. Ha. It is well for those who can
  laugh—let them do so—there is no extra charge. The light-
  hearted cup and the convivial jest for them—but for me—what is
  there for me?
  <br>
  <h5 class="SILLI">SILLI</h5>
<p class="directions">There is some claret-cup and lobster salad [handing some]</p>
  <br>
  <h5 class="THIS">THES</h5>
<p>[taking it] Thank you. [Resuming] What is there for me but
  anxiety—ceaseless gnawing anxiety that tears at my very vitals
  and rends my peace of mind asunder? There is nothing whatever
  for me but anxiety of the nature I have just described. The
  charge of these thoughtless revellers is my unhappy lot. It is
  not a small charge, and it is rightly termed a lot because there
  are many. Oh why did the gods make me a manager?
</p>
  <br>
 <h5 class="SPAR">SPAR</h5> 
 <P class="directions">Phoebus am I, with golden ray,
       The god of day, the god of day.
       When shadowy night has held her sway,
       I make the goddesses fly.
       Tis mine the task to wake the world,
       In slumber curled, in slumber curled.
       By me her charms are all unfurled
       The god of day am I.</P>
       <br>

  <h5 class="CHO">CHO</h5>
  <P class="song name"> The god of day, the god of day,
       The park shall our Sparkeion play,
       Ha Ha, etc.
       The rarest fun and rarest fare
       That ever fell to mortal share
       Ha ha etc.
    </P>
    <br>

  <h5 class="NICE">NICE</h5>
  <P class="directions"> I am the moon, the lamp of night.
       I show a light — I show a light.
       With radiant sheen I put to flight
       The shadows of the sky.
       By my fair rays, as you're aware,
       Gay lovers swear—gay lovers swear,
       While greybeards sleep away their care,
       The lamp of night am I.
    </P>
